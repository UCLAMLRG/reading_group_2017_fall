Week 3 instructions. We will be looking at Neural Networks this week.

Readings: Chapter 6 from deeplearningbook.com, stop at 6.2.2. Also for a refresher, look at chapter 1 for how NN, Deep learning fits 
into the scheme of things.

For some hands-on coding, look at http://choonsiong.com/public/books/Big%20Data/Data%20Science%20from%20Scratch.pdf p. 213-- we'll be going
over this in class as well.
